üç≥ Cooking Magic

Cooking Magic is a simple and enjoyable recipe app that makes cooking feel personal. It‚Äôs built for anyone who loves experimenting in the kitchen or just wants to keep their favorite meals all in one place. The app lets users add their own recipes with ingredients, instructions, and portion sizes, so every dish can be customized exactly the way it‚Äôs made at home. Recipes can also be edited or removed whenever needed, keeping everything neat and up to date.

Users can mark recipes they really like as favorites, and those will be saved in a separate section for easy access. There‚Äôs also a Pantry feature that helps keep track of ingredients you already have. Based on what‚Äôs listed in the pantry, the app can suggest recipes that match those ingredients, which makes meal planning easier and helps reduce food waste.

Cooking Magic also includes a Scan feature that allows users to take a picture of a written recipe or ingredient list, and the app automatically converts it into text that can be saved or edited. Recipes can be searched by typing in a specific ingredient, and the app will show dishes that use it.

All recipes are grouped into simple categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, supper, and snacks, making it easy to browse and find what you‚Äôre looking for. The app starts with a welcoming home page that leads to a smooth login and sign up process for new users.

Cooking Magic makes it easy to store personal recipes, discover new ones, manage ingredients, and organize meals in one convenient app. The app was built using Kotlin for Android development. It uses Firebase as the main database to store user data, recipes, and pantry items. The Glide API is used for smooth and efficient image loading throughout the app.

Dependencies used: Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, Glide, and standard Android libraries for layouts, navigation, and user interface.
